## Asymmetric Lock Box building
In this repository you find the files to make your Asymmetric Lock Box, in the folder [Asymmetric Lock Box](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box) you can find tree folders: [Acrylic Lids](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Acrylic%20Lids), [STEP Files](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/STEP%20Files) and [STL Files](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/STL%20Files).

In the file [Ensamblaje.PDF](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/blob/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Ensamblaje.PDF) you can see the all pieces of the box and the material, we recomended uses PLA to de printed pieces and acrilic to the lids, but you can try using other materials.

### 3D Printing
For the 3D printing process you need the STL Files, so following the file to [assembly](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/blob/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Ensamblaje.PDF) you will which pieces and how many you need pirnt, and then you can find the STL file for each part.

### Acrylic Lids
For lids we recomended use acrylic to make it, but you can use other material like wood and others.
In the folder [Acrylic Lids](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Acrylic%20Lids) you can dowload the files to cut and laser engraving the lids.
