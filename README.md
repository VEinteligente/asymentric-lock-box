## Asymmetric Lock Box building
In this repository you find the files to make your Asymmetric Lock Box, in the folder [Asymmetric Lock Box](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box) you can find tree folders: [Acrylic Lids](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Acrylic%20Lids), [STEP Files](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/STEP%20Files) and [STL Files](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/STL%20Files).

In the file [Ensamblaje.PDF](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/blob/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Ensamblaje.PDF) you can see the all pieces of the box and the material, we recomended uses PLA+ or PLA to the printed pieces and acrilic to the lids, but you can try using other materials.

### Box Dimensions
Length: 21.2cm

Width: 16.7cm

Depth: 2.7cm

### 3D Printing
For the 3D printing process you need the STL Files, so following the file to [assembly](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/blob/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Ensamblaje.PDF) you will find which pieces and how many you need print, and then you can find the STL file for each part.

### Acrylic Lids
For lids we recomended use acrylic to make it, but you can use others materials like wood or any other.
In the folder [Acrylic Lids](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/Acrylic%20Lids) you can dowload the files to cut and laser engraving the lids.

### Model to edit
The folder [STEP Files](https://github.com/VEinteligente/asymentric-lock-box/tree/main/Asymmetric%20Lock%20Box/STEP%20Files) has the file for each part and you can make little changes.
